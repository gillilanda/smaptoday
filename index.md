This is the website for my Environmental Remote Sensing final project. 

For my project, I’m interested in comparing the freeze/thaw extent of soil since 2015 using the Soil Moisture Passive Microwave (SMAP) satellite data. I work at the National Snow and Ice Data Center to publish and archive SMAP data, so I’m interested in understanding the data from a more scientific perspective. I’m also very interested in the impacts of frozen soil/permafrost shrinking due to climate change.
